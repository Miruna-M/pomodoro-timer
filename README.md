# Pomodoro Timer
Webapp for time management using the Pomodoro Method developed by Francesco Cirillo which alternates between timed 25-minute work sessions and short 5-minute breaks, as well as longer 15-minute breaks. 

The user can manually start/stop the timer and switch between pomodoro work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks.
